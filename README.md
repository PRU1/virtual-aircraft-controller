# Traffic controller

## Overview

Aircraft traffic controllers can misinterpret audio transmissions. Our project uses Boson AI API to interpret an air traffic controller's audio transmissions to generate unambiguous instructions for pilots within the vicinity of an airport. A simulated ATC screen helps visualize how our instructions are carried out.
